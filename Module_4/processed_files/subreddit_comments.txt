...
it
slowli
rotat
definit
i
saw
that
at
the
fairground
as
well
saw
this
car
in
philadelphia
at
the
autoshow
be
work
with
my
grandfath
help
get
our
car
out
but
take
a
break
to
watch
the
mustang
roll
out
when
this
car
start
up
your
entir
chest
shake
be
your
friend
ricki
bobbi
you'r
probabl
right
i
onli
ride
in
it
a
coupl
of
time
i
suspect
that
what
i'm
rememb
be
the
lack
of
turn
signal
indic
on
the
dashboard
the
instrument
panel
be
smooth
where
the
littl
green
light
arrow
would
normal
have
be
that
what
i
be
think
of
the
car
be
almost
unbeliev
bare
base
entri
level
);
no
carpet
onli
a
rubber
floor
line
and
the
door
didn't
even
have
arm
rest
basic
no
chrome
anywher
except
for
the
bumper
and
the
front
grill
insert
i'v
often
wonder
how
much
more
effici
it
could
be
make
use
today
design
technolog
my
66
be
virtual
all
metal
except
for
the
interior
trim
i
rememb
my
shock
when
first
calcul
my
daili
citi
mileag
at
8
mpg
i'd
like
to
think
that
modern
tech
could
at
least
doubl
that
for
the
same
size
car
today
then
own
such
a
beauti
wouldn't
be
quit
so
financi
pain
yes
the
best
part
be
walk
up
to
a
giant
piec
of
roll
art
sculptur
each
day
everi
inch
of
it
flow
togeth
as
if
a
singl
visionari
concept
have
be
form
into
steel
glass
and
rubber
as
you
get
closer
to
it
the
end
sort
of
extend
out
to
the
horizon
and
it
begin
to
wrap
itself
around
you
in
safeti
and
comfort
there
be
noth
weird
about
this
car
it
a
gorgeous
car
though
it
an
ok
price
but
i
person
wouldn't
pay
more
than
5500
6000
for
it
the
interior
look
like
it
be
redon
incorect
at
some
point
and
if
you
wanna
drop
a
v8
in
it
you'r
gonna
need
some
extra
cash
besid
that
it
a
pretti
cool
ride
i'm
17
and
my
person
daili
be
a
1963
ford
fairlan
i'm
sure
your
son
will
love
the
car
as
much
as
i
love
mine
thank
for
the
input
could
you
help
me
by
explain
how
they
do
the
interior
wrong
https://youtu.be/zozbtlzpoey
good
job
on
the
v6
i
would
of
kill
myself
if
i
be
your

get
alot
of
go
but
not
a

of
stop
see

for
more
inform
it
either
would
have
or
would
ve
but
never
would
of
i
think
upgrad
to

will
be
the
first
thing
i
do
smart
i
agre
well
for
starter
the
steer
wheel
isn't
stock
the
center
consol
be
nowher
close
to
the
origin
the
seat
belt
be
the
wrong
color
and
the
door
panel
with
the
red
paint
on
top
and
bottom
may
be
incorrect
not
100
sure
about
this
though
howev
these
be
thing
that
can
be
easili
fix
if
you
do
want
an
origin
look
so
it
not
a
big
deal
honest
if
you
can
get
it
for
less
than
7000
i'd
say
do
it
becaus
you
have
a
good
run
car
that
you
can
either
upgrad
or
leav
stock
and
either
way
it
cool
thank
for
the
head
up
i'll
tri
to
use
those
be
bargan
chip
tonight
it
a
chevi
virtual
everi
engin
part
be
interchang
i
guess
that
doe
make
sens
if
i
realli
care
i
could
go
so
far
as
match
up
an
appropri
date
code
for
the
car
i
can
onli
imagin
the
offic
who
get
to
drive
it
leave
everi
day
with
a
massiv
grin
on
his
face
about
20
year
ago
there
be
a
oregon
state
polic
mustang
5.0
that
patrol
highway
18
on
the
way
to
the
coast
there
a
stretch
that
straighten
out
and
i
rememb
him
pass
me
at
a
ridicul
rate
of
speed
on
it
to
catch
a
drink
driver
up
ahead
i
don't
doubt
it
fhp
use
to
have
a
few
ss
camaro
befor
they
get
rid
of
them
those
be
wick
fast
too
if
it
isn't
it
should
be
lx
5.0
coup
not
a
gt
my
bad
i
appreci
the
correct
i
alway
make
the
mistak
of
call
it
a
gt
when
i
see
the
5.0
on
the
side
i
have
an
88
gt
back
in
1990
but
if
i
have
it
to
do
over
again
i
would
have
buy
the
lx
coup
there
be
also
a
5.0
ford
ltd
that
be
pretti
much
the
same
car
with
4
door
i
have
one
in
high
school
and
it
be
damn
quick
i
think
the
biggest
differ
from
the
stock
ltd
and
the
polic
interceptor
model
i
have
be
the
suspens
and
the
5.0
engin
thank
my
friend
have
an
ltd
but
it
be
auto
and
that
slush
box
be
aw
mustang
redneck
porsch
what
the
car
on
the
right
i
don't
think
so
the
coup
have
a
particular
rooflin
that
and
power
brake
sad
i
can't
find
ani
dual
bowl
mcs
for
the
1964/5
6
mustang
cj
have
a
singl
bowl
that
should
work
fine
though
what
price
ring
be
the
longb
in
evolut
of
bmw
nose
i
don't
know
if
you
guy
know
matt
farah
or
the
host
of
thesmokingtir
youtub
channel
but
his
mustang
also
use
to
be
a
polic
car
actual
just
watch
a
video
mention
that
the
190sl
he
trade
would
be
worth
a
pretti
dollar
give
the
motor
a
tuneup
to
freshen
it
up
a
bite
more
on
power
drive
abil
later
on
if
you
feel
the
v6
you
be
put
in
be
a
bite
sluggish
be
probabl
a
good
idea
as
well
look
great
onli
thing
id
do
be
mayb
put
on
some
wider
tire
on
all
4
corner
or
at
least
the
rear
to
make
it
look
a
bite
less
awkward
at
the
rear
heh
mayb
will
be
enough
just
have
a
spacer
that
move
the
rear
rim
out
a
bite
so
it
fill
the
bodi
a
bite
more
god
where
do
peopl
find
these
