From performing the Natural Language Process, I noticed a couple limitations. One of the biggest limitations I noticed was the
package's lack of understanding of punctuation. From the trump_processed.txt file, many punctuations, or at least unrecognizable
characters, are still there. This may be valuable if they were emojis as it helps show sentiment, but most of them are just
random characters. Overall, it's hard cleaning up Twitter data as there are so many different edge cases.
