Looks great!

One of the most unique tmogs  have seen. Very nice.

Thanks

Your Boots ðŸ¤¥

Very very cool. I really like this one.

[oh dope im about to get it lol](http://i.imgur.com/dxwEczA.jpg)

It is the marksmanship hunter artifact weapon.

which item gives you the arrows on your back

They really should have stuck with frost as the tank spec, blood as a physical dmg/bleeds dps spec, and unholy as the magical dmg melee spec

What are the swords on the DK?

Shoulder: Hateful Gladiator's Plate Shoulders

Back: Greatcloak of the Chosen Dead

Chest: Chestplate of the Chosen Dead

Hands: Hateful Gladiator's Plate Gauntlets

Waist: Waistplate of the Chosen Dead

Legs: Primal Gladiator's Plate Legguards

Feet: Primal Gladiator's Warboots of Cruelty

2H Weapons: Lord Alexander's Battle Axe

Cheers! :) I thought that the screenshot would not be very good  but I 'm glad you like it!

I personally dislike the full Monk sets with a passion... but this looks awesome!

Chest : Llothien jerkin

Shirt : Antiseptic-soaked dressings

Belt : Frostwolf scout's belt

Gloves : Reaping gloves of the aleifir

Pants : Noblewoman's skirt

Boots : Boots of the broken

Weapong : Dragonsaw boneblade

I'd say 5/8 should differ from the full set. 3 pieces of a set is usually plenty enough for me.

Just curious; how many items must be changed from a set before it's considered a decent transmog?

The boots are from that set. So a helm and a cape we cant even see. 



Wow a full set! Where did you come up with this super unique transmog from??

Those are the PvP boots from the same tier/set. 

I love this set! I'm trying to build it on my pandaman. 

Edit: also the RF tint looks the coolest imo. 

Not really a transmog if it's a set

Back ~~waist~~ feet 

Head and?

He was too young.

4 items...

Haha same here. My paladin has a death knight transmog and my mistweaver monk looks like a warlock.

A full set with only one item changed? Alright

I also like making sets that don't fit the class at all! For example my paladin looks like a warrior and my warrior looks like a death knight.

He's fearless cuz he can't see shit. 

They should of only let pandas be monks imo

:D

You blinede me with Science!

Made this remark several times. Sometimes I wonder if people are hiding the mismatched colors of their mog or something by taking screens in a blue, green, red, etc atmosphere. 

Dumb otherwise?

Links to gear?

Not a fan of the blue boots and silver shoulders, should just takr the wrathful boots too then

Indeed. Ambience is nice but we want to see your mog. Take two screenies!

That and really low dropchance.

Still grieving Vol'jin.

Where is his face

<3

Yeah that's probably your best bet if you have the gold. SoO is a pain to farm.

Wouldn't mind the entire set, might pick it up from BMAH if I ever see it cheap.

Agreed I'd love to know the items for this. It's pretty damn sweet.

I've been trying to get the Dark Shaman helm for ages now. I'm super jealous.

Waist: Shieldguard Girdle


Legs: Hemet's Armored Legguards

Sorry my first thought was Jimmy Nuetron, that dog looks way too much like Goddard

I love the mog! Would probably prefer the all white hair but that's small potatoes. Also Idk why in my head I can't see a belf using a huge axe? *Shrug* anyways - looks very cool. 

Everyone can have mechanical pets by using an engineering crafted item but gnomes and goblins get it natively. Most pets come from the world but the mechano-scorpions are crafted out of reagents from SoO.

http://www.wow-petopia.com/family.php?id=mechanical

So I stopped playing like halfway through WoD. With the gnome hunters, where do you find the pets? They all have to be mechanical, right? Is there a place to find pets like this in the wild, or do you have to craft them, or both? Also can all the other races have mechanical pets or is it just unique to gnomes?

Yes.  He had red eyes prior, but not glowy,

Love the Name, LOOOOVE engineering themes.  A+

I like this a lot, gj.

I will post the item list in the morning

The hood gives the red eye glow?

I'm pretty sure the new 7.2 sets tab would show you, right?

http://www.wowhead.com/item=18867/grand-marshals-battle-hammer

Should go with the same model as Light's Vengeance then?

[Dressing room!](http://www.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Vk0c0zJ8zkz0z9m8DNE8qg87mBVp808rJE87cJin808vnp86P8eTf808Fhk8zz48Eje808CiK87cg)

The default set tab shows the ones you're missing as greyed out.

The transmog set tab doesn't show you any info, but the appearances tab shows the list of items.

I use mOnAr's Wardrobe Helper. Shows you what you have and where to get what you don't.

Ohhh that sexy 360 though.  Lookin good!

Looks really cool, I like the use of red! 

The Stormpike tabard works pretty well I find@

The white forsaken mount from the argent tournament would look great with this set.

Hat looks like the Stylin Adventure Hat, which leather workers can craft.

Optional title - Whatever-I-have-that-fits-together-mog

Orgrimmar Chest, boots and gloves.

Legs are: Soul-Stealer's Chain Pants

Belt: Grenadier's belt.

Cloak: Hidden

Shoulders: Living Mountain Shoulderguards

Head: Crown of Destruction

Not done that much, but I think the overall looks are quite good. Warrior I can not transmog something else, feels really wrong. 

Itemlist:

* Weapons: Hanzo Sword (Illusion: Crusader)
* Helm: Hidden
* Shoulders: Expedition Mantle
* Cloak: Hidden
* Chest: Reanimated Armor
* Shirt: Stylish Black Shirt
* Wrist: Deathlord's Bracers
* Hands: Flamefury Gauntlets
* Belt: Enchanted Adamantite Belt
* Legs: Enchanted Adamantite Leggings
* Feet: Greaves of the Sublime Superiority

I like it. 

Now that's an interesting take on a Dark Iron shaman. Keeps with the theme of the race, but still distinctive shaman look. Or maybe a super aggressive DnD style cleric. 

I changed it a little bit: http://imgur.com/a/84PlW i dont know which i like best, but i do like the paladin look for DK's

i really like the whole fallen paladin look

I'm not sure what kind of helmet you had in mind, but [here](http://i.imgur.com/2Ni7x4k.png)) is something that could work. Also assumed that you meant a male blood elf when you said male version. :-)

No problem thanks :D


FYI 4 steps my friend.

1) print screen

2) open  imgur

3) ctrl+v

4) ????

5) Profit

That also helps, but not all the time. There are still areas where the lighting fucks up the screenshot even when you target yourself.

I like it! Not flashy at all, and captures the "rogue" feel well.

Weapon http://www.wowhead.com/item=72828/tricksters-edge

Boots http://www.wowhead.com/item=87153/asanis-uncleansed-sandals

A male version would be epic.  Maybe replace the hood with a helm.

I really liked this one, thanks for posting!

The fact that you even remembered is amazing! Appreciate it!

Head-Hood of Fading Opportunity

Shoulders- Ritualistic Shoulderguards

Cloak-Poisonmist Nightcloak

Chest-Shatari Deadeye Vest

Gloves-Shatari Deadeye Gloves

Belt-Warmonging Gladiators Waistguard

Legs-Shatari Deadeye Leggings

Boots-Shatari Deadeye Sabatons

Weapon-Andoros, Fist of the Dragon King

Well, its not aesthetically my favorite model.  However, was looking for a more effective color match, which I feel I achieved.  The model does need some work thou... looks like an old, moldy piece of chewed up bubble gum, straight from the cavern floors of Blackrock Mountain. 

so... list of items ?? as rules say...


I think the UVs are bad on the model, but I mean if it works for you then cool beans

Not bad-Just.....well, somewhat odd looking.  

Do those shoulders have a bad texture?  

According to [this Wowhead guide](http://ptr.wowhead.com/nethershard-currency-broken-shore), you should be able to get the [ensemble version of the set](http://www.wowhead.com/item=139169/ensemble-felshroud-leather-armor) in 7.2 
> Remember the Legion Invasion vendors added back when Patch 7.0 dropped? Since the Nethershards added in Broken Shore are the same currency as used there, you can now buy any items that you weren't able to buy during the pre-Legion invasions! 



I used to dual wield those on my Fury Warrior. Sure wish we could transmog the Fury Artifacts back to 1-handers for some of that Single Minded Fury goodness

It's transmog, then.

I can definitely see where you're coming from, but it's actually not what inspired me.

I only really wanted to make a set around the hood since I don't like the clipping from most of the helmets on elves, and this is one of the few things that I can live with. (And I do want helmets on my elves)

Shall we call it.. Light Ranger...? :D 

That's amazing, I see you went for the negative image of the Sylvanus whatsits, Dark Rangers or whatever they're called?

I am still salty about not making it for MoP challenge modes. 3/9 gold.

that's the fun of xmog, grinding until you have the perfect image 

Probably but I don't have any of them.

From what I can see

Head: Shaman ICC set

Shoulders: Shaman (mail) pvp Legion

Chest(Legs): Shaman ICC set

Gloves: Shaman ICC set

Belt: Shaman Class hall set

Weapons: Gorefiend HFC (Normal I think?)
