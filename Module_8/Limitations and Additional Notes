Please note the negative_tweets.json and positive_tweets.json are modified version of the original samples from Python
NLTK's #75 Twitter Samples (http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/).

Limitations of this sentiment classifier include:
- Sarcasm
- Repeated phrases with not much context (i.e. ORIOLES NUMBER ONE! ORIOLES NUMBER ONE! ORIOLES NUMBER ONE!)
- Very slow
- Using the same training data set for Twitter as with Reddit
- Does not account for emojis, pictures, or links included
- Neutral statements, such as strictly information-passing statements
