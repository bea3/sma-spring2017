/uj I honestly think half the time he just makes educated guesses. I mean, it's usually not difficult to figure out what is going to happen. Then if he's wrong, he just says "plans changed"

COMMENT #2
Unfortunately a Kevin Owens shirt on WWE.com to put on any man walking the street is more than $10.

COMMENT #3
uj/ you should do these monthly or for the big 4

$9 functional muscle

COMMENT #5
It's still a shoot (insider term) to me dammit.

COMMENT #6
It's on my Mum's card, but I'll still sing the praises of its value to other toxic shitbags who would rather hear people complain about and spoil wrestling than actually watch it.

COMMENT #7
UJ/ I said something similar to this on a thread on r/sc and the amount of fanboys defending his every wrong call is hilarious. They can never accept the fact that Dave could actually be wrong from the beginning. Someone even called me jealous because Dave is making money of it and I'm not, just lmao. 

COMMENT #8
B-but one of these neckbeards managed to procreate! How is he supposed to feed his child now? Get a real job? Anyone got a link to their Patreon? I already pay one crotchety old fuck to complain about wrestling, what's a few (young) bucks more?

btw did anyone see that *incredible* reaction by newlegacyinc? Hear when one of these portly asthmatics said "Fuck you" to a character on his TV? INCREDIBLE! Subscribe here, Patreon here

COMMENT #9
Big if true

This is obviously fake, the 'E hates Bae-J Stules.

COMMENT #11
But your $10.99 isn't

COMMENT #12
You know what would get me to cheer TJP?? After Roman comes back from his quote unquote injuries next week (lol super roman (eyeroll)) TJP should straight up pull out a gun and shoot him. Dead Roman would make me cheer. 

COMMENT #13
he never said that AJ was going to Raw. He said that AJ was(n't) going to Raw. See? 

COMMENT #14
That's Goldust's theme though.

Please do it for me(/r/Shibata mod) 

COMMENT #23
Like fuck Russo, what a cancer to wrestling, so out of touch and overstayed his welcome (which was very overrated with what I have watched from 1998 in youtube). 

Wait? He is shitting on HHH? Oh, he is definitely right this time, never said anything of essence before but this...maybe wwe should hire him back.

High chance someone will go over, according to my sources. 

COMMENT #27
Meltzer, any chance that someone will go over?

COMMENT #28
Plans must of been changed. Lord Meltz is never wrong

COMMENT #29
BUY BUY BUY Renders(insider term), gifs, videos, or vague descriptions of the Chamber of Horrors match whenever anyone references the next Wyatt/Orton match.

COMMENT #30
At least they did before they changed his font in order to bury him.

COMMENT #31
It's becoming increasingly difficult to chant fruit roll up because a belt isn't black leather when it's not on my TV every week.


DAE love Cody RHODES(insider term) with the white IC belt?

Drama is the greatest mod, and a girl btw, so you better show proper respect 

COMMENT #41
If the measure of a good heel is how much you like the guy (and it is) then Miz is hands down the best in the world. He gets the right kind of heat, too--us laughing our asses off at his hilarious skits. Not laughing at him of course, but with him. 

COMMENT #42
Who? 

COMMENT #43
Meltz, what does this have to do with the Tokyo Dome?

COMMENT #44
Flo Rida

Again.

COMMENT #45
He's only boring when he doesn't care which is why his match against Husky Harris was so bad

COMMENT #46
What single event annoyed r/sc the most violently?

COMMENT #47
OOOHH LAWD

COMMENT #48
You dense motherfucker!!!  The greatest match of all time was Kenny Omega vs K(vowels and consonants) Okada.  Meltzer, in his infinite, constantly right, wisdom, invalidated his own rating scale just to tell us how FUCKING AMAZING this match was!!! Six STaRS!@##!@$@#T

Is that not piracy or am I off base here?  

COMMENT #52
Yeah check the this week's RAW thread. They even have 2 steams hosted by /r/squaredcircle (although they do every show,  not just WWE. 

COMMENT #53
JBL

COMMENT #54
Kind of.  We got AJ AND Nakamura.

KO held the U.S. title for a while building up the New Face of America gimmick (lost it to Mojo at SummerSlam thanks to Gronk) and afterwards started a feud with Nak that AJ was around for a good part of the year, it seems.

Ziggler (channeling the better "bad HBK" gimmick now) sort of became the new Jericho to KO but the Ziggler/KO dynamic was more serious and less emotional.

ZigKO won the SD tag titles at some point (sending the rest of the SD tag division to the ARMBAR) and lost them to AJ and Nak at Mania.

COMMENT #55
But but at NJPW Sega genocide they, according to my Japanese translator and understanding of Japanese from my exquisite anime collection, called it airbrush saturation, but who am I to question the will of the Meltzie? 

COMMENT #56
Did we get AJ vs Nakamura?

COMMENT #57
I heard the Meltz call it a full body RENDER so it must be true.

COMMENT #58
WOO CRISPY give me fucking meme karma

COMMENT #59
Man, that match was slow, boring, and was only a bunch of stupid looking strikes. Wait, Meltzie gave it 5 stars? DAE GOAT MATCH!? 

COMMENT #60
LOL I love it when Miz does the John Cena skits, it makes me laugh and shows how much Miz loves his work. DAE Miz is the best heel in the company? 

COMMENT #61
Anyone but Roman...... Oh wait.

COMMENT #62
It's "airbrush saturation". Fuckin mark.

COMMENT #63
/uj I had a guy in the Smackdown thread trying to explain to me how Nakamura didn't need to be able to cut a promo. 

COMMENT #64
Big Dave gets me so hard

COMMENT #65
"Hey Colt Cabana!" 

COMMENT #66
Fuck him for having positive experiences with JBL. He should lie and make up bullying stories.

COMMENT #67
While hhh has been a controversial figure among the smarks, based papa haitch from nxt is God tier for signing muh indie darlings 

COMMENT #68
None at all.

The actual main event was for the Universal Title, Braun Strowman vs. Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar.  It was Lesnar's rematch from Fastlane: Beginning of the Line, where Roman beat him for the title via... cheating.

The finish was Royal Rumble winner Braun pinning Brock clean.  Roman was just late in breaking up the three count.

After the match, Roman got in Braun's face but Lesnar got up and the giants stared down the big dog until he backed off and went back to the stage.

The show ended with a seemingly friendly moment between Braun and Lesnar interrupted by a surprise F5 out of no where and Lesnar's music.

Brock picked up the Universal title and laid it over Strowman as he left the ring with Heyman.

COMMENT #69
How much trash got thrown in the ring during the main event

COMMENT #70
Shower thought: What if he's really seeking psychiatric treatment because he's a compulsive liar and this is all a work? Is it possible we've been had by the Big Dog?

COMMENT #71
This is gold 

COMMENT #72
OMG, people are so dumb they just do what Vince wants! I think for myself, dammit! I don't have to cheer his hand picked golden boy, who has nothing but a look, who never paid his dues, has no work rate, no charisma, did nothing to earn that spot that he stole from wrestlers who deserve it twice as much, but will always be overlooked and that's why they are midcard jobbers. Damn you Vince, I'm sobbing into my Seth Rollins Bleacher Creature right now!

COMMENT #73
Same thing with him pushing Roman off the ledge strapped to the stretcher. Landing pads were placed below and Braun grabbed the end and flipped it before it went over so Roman could feet first. Then the camera followed Strowman as they removed the pads. 

Go back and watch. When the camera returns after following Braun leaning, the stretcher is in a totally different position. 

COMMENT #74
that's plausible

COMMENT #75
A winch on the other side was pulling it over. That's why they carefully shot it to only show one side of the ambulance. 

COMMENT #76
Uj/ I actually think he did it with no help

COMMENT #77
God they do? Fucking who moderates that shit? Seriously did not know this!!

COMMENT #78
Uj/ because they started asking inappropriate questions in the comments 

COMMENT #79
DAE roman should get -6 stars

DAE reigns is fat af under that vest. 

COMMENT #81
but devitt paid his dues in the indies!!! REEEEEE

COMMENT #82
"I will not be hindered."

COMMENT #83
/uj I actually like NJPW but those posts are just the worst. I got downvoted for saying that I liked the company but they make long shows and I don't have time to watch them.

/rj Okada is having such a great year right now! He totally doesn't have a bland, unlikeable character like Reigns, and the promoters totally don't worship him like Vince does Fuccboi!

COMMENT #84
Well, at Payback titles could change hands or not change hands. Plans may change. There will be matches. Thanks that'll be 10.99.

COMMENT #85
I don't give a shit just spoil the next PPV for me please. 

COMMENT #86
Also, Ambrose is on RAW, which I am doubling down on still being cancer because Roman. 

COMMENT #87
Vince is so fucking oblivious, Romans entire career has been a mess and he's getting booed as a face. What the fuck that's not how it's supposed to work.  

BAEJ on the other hand has been doing masterful heel work.  His character development is phenomenal (lol get it) and you can really hear how much the audience just despises him for the literally perfect wrestler that he is.  He just gets it and really knows how to work the crowd, and his mic skills are almost as good as Shinskey Nakamauro's.

Fuck me you are clever

COMMENT #91
DAE Think it's crazy that Meltz never gives out 6 star ratings anymore???

COMMENT #92
Now it sounds like they'll probably keep him off for awhile. DAE cowardly Vince hiding Fuccboi from the Undertaker boos? I won't forget, I WILL NEVER FORGET that Cena should have had that accolade!

COMMENT #93
Is "paint" an inside term. ELI5 plz.

Fuck, I thought it was intentional, haha.

Speaking of Karma, upvote plz, I speak for the people (like Paul Heyman DAE MIKE LIONT Brock Lesnar?! xD)

COMMENT #96
Jesus fucking christ. It's taken this long for anyone (including me) to notice. Have a pink star.

COMMENT #97
2007? Is this a stock report rewind?

COMMENT #98
I just want him to go away for a few months. I'll worry about what kind of plans they have for him when Meltz says he's coming back.

COMMENT #99
uj/ Damn, she really did? Why tho

COMMENT #100
I think he's next NXT champ, so this is a smart buy.
